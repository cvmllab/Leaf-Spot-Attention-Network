# Leaf-Spot-Attention-Network

This code is an implementation of our paper "Leaf spot attention network for apple leaf disease identification" published in IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (IEEE CVPR), Agriculture-Vision Workshop, 2020.

The proposed model can be used not only for apple leaves, but also for classification of various leaf diseases.

This source code was implemented in Matlab 2019a version and tested on Window 10.

-     'train.m' is the source code to train the proposed leaf spot attention network.
-     'evaluate.m' is the source code to test the pretrained network.

For reference, more training images are added to train our leaf spot attention network. Therefore, its classification results are slightly different from those in the paper.

The dataset and our pretrained network can be downloaded.
